NAME
    Scalar::Random::PP - Scalar::Random in Pure Perl

SYNOPSIS
        use Scalar::Random 'randomize';

        my $random;
        my $MAX_RANDOM = 100;

        randomize( $random, $MAX_RANDOM );

        print $random, "\n"; # '42'
        print $random, "\n"; # '17'
        print $random, "\n"; # '88'
        print $random, "\n"; # '4'
        print $random, "\n"; # '50'
        use inc::Module::Install;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is intended to be a pure Perl replacement for
    Scalar::Random.

    Please see Scalar::Random for full details.

NOTE
    This module was written as a pair programming excerise between Ingy döt
    Net and Webster Montego.

    The module passes all the same tests as Scalar::Random, even though we
    felt there could be more elaborate testing. Perhaps we'll add the tests
    we'd like to see, so that Alfie John can backport them. :)

    We also thought it would be nice if randomize took a lower limit, but we
    decided not to change the API unless Alfie did so first, so that the PP
    module would be an exact replacement.
