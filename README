NAME
    Scalar::Random::PP - Scalar::Random in Pure Perl

SYNOPSIS
        use Scalar::Random::PP 'randomize';

        my $random;
        my $MAX_RANDOM = 100;

        randomize( $random, $MAX_RANDOM );

        print $random, "\n"; # '42'
        print $random, "\n"; # '17'
        print $random, "\n"; # '88'
        print $random, "\n"; # '4'
        print $random, "\n"; # '50'

DESCRIPTION
    This module is intended to be a pure Perl replacement for
    Scalar::Random.

    Please see Scalar::Random for full details.

NOTES
    This module was written as a pair programming excerise between Webster
    Montego and Ingy döt Net.

    The module passes all the same tests as Scalar::Random, even though we
    felt there could be more exhaustive testing. Perhaps we'll add the tests
    we'd like to see, so that Alfie John can backport them. :)

    We also thought it would be nice if randomize took a lower limit, but we
    decided not to change the API unless Alfie did so first, so that the PP
    module would be an exact replacement.

    We used the speedy and zero-dep Mousse module for OO goodness, and
    packaged it all up with the lovely Module::Install and friends.
